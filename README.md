(You may base this on the number of exercises you were able to complete)
how many points out of 20 do you deserve on this assignment: I believe I deserve full points because I finished all the exercises and passed all the tests.

## Self-Reflection:
<!-- What did you learn that you found interesting --> I gained greater knowledge on javascript. I also discovered that Cypress has a special test runner that enables us to watch commands as they are carried out. It also displays how the programme being tested is running in real-time.

### How long it took you to finish this?
It took me around 3 hours to complete all the exercises.
